# LeadScore_LogisticRegression_Model
Building a logistic regression model to assign a lead score

Problem Statement

X Education, an online course provider for industry professionals, faces challenges with its lead conversion process, resulting in a low conversion rate of approximately 30%. The company seeks to identify potential leads, or 'Hot Leads', with higher conversion probabilities to enhance efficiency and increase conversions. The objective is to develop a predictive model that assigns lead scores to individual leads, prioritizing those with the greatest likelihood of conversion into paying customers. The target is to achieve a lead conversion rate of around 80%. The solution aims to optimize resource allocation within the sales team by focusing efforts on leads with the highest predicted conversion probabilities, thereby improving overall lead conversion rates and maximizing revenue potential for X Education.

Business Objective

Build a logistic regression model to assign a lead score between 0 and 100 to each of the leads which can be used by the company to target potential leads. A higher score would mean that the lead is hot, i.e. is most likely to convert whereas a lower score would mean that the lead is cold and will mostly not get converted. A ballpark of the target lead conversion rate to be around 80%.
